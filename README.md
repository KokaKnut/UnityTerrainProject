# UnityTerrainProject

You are a guide for a scientific expedition to be done deep in the mountains. It seems like every other expedition, but disaster strikes as the plane suffers engine failure. Miraculously, you survive in one piece while the rest of the crew perished. As you wake up, you notice it is now night, and can hear a search plane above. You need to reach somewhere in these mountains that they can reach you. You set off with just a flashlight and follow a very old mountain road not marked on any map.
